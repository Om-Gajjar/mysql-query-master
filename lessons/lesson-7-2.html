<h1 class="mb-4">7.2 Ensuring Data Quality: Constraints Overview</h1>

<p>SQL <strong>constraints</strong> are rules applied to table columns (or the table itself) to enforce data integrity and accuracy. They restrict the type of data that can be inserted, updated, or deleted in a table, preventing errors and maintaining the consistency of your database.</p>

<p>Constraints are typically defined when a table is created using <code>CREATE TABLE</code>, but some can also be added later using <code>ALTER TABLE</code> (though altering tables can be complex).</p>

<p>Key types of constraints include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><code>NOT NULL</code></strong>: Ensures that a column cannot contain <code>NULL</code> values. Every row must have a value for this column.</li>
    <li><strong><code>UNIQUE</code></strong>: Guarantees that all values in a column (or a set of columns) are distinct across all rows in the table. Allows <code>NULL</code> values (and typically allows multiple <code>NULL</code>s, though this varies slightly by database system).</li>
    <li><strong><code>PRIMARY KEY</code></strong>: A combination of <code>NOT NULL</code> and <code>UNIQUE</code>. Uniquely identifies each row in the table. A table can have only one primary key (which might consist of multiple columns).</li>
    <li><strong><code>FOREIGN KEY</code></strong>: Establishes and enforces a link between data in two tables. It ensures that values in a column (or group of columns) in one table match values in a specified column (usually the primary key) of another table. This maintains referential integrity.</li>
    <li><strong><code>CHECK</code></strong>: Specifies a condition that must be true for any value inserted or updated in a column. For example, ensuring a price is always greater than zero.</li>
    <li><strong><code>DEFAULT</code></strong>: Provides a default value for a column when an <code>INSERT</code> statement does not specify a value for it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using constraints is fundamental to good database design. They act as a safeguard at the database level, ensuring that your data remains reliable and consistent, regardless of how applications interact with it.</p>

<p>In the following lessons, we'll look at some of these constraints in more detail.</p>
