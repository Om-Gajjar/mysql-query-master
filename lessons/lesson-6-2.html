<h1 class="mb-4">6.2 Combining Everything: FULL OUTER JOIN</h1>

<p>What if you want *all* rows from *both* tables, matching them up where possible and showing <code>NULL</code> where matches don't exist on either side? That's the purpose of the <code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code> (or just <code>FULL JOIN</code>).</p>

<p>It combines the results of both a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> and a <code>RIGHT JOIN</code>.</p>

<p>Conceptual Syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql line-numbers">
SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2, ...
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.related_column = table2.related_column;
WHERE condition; -- Optional
</code></pre>

<p>Example: List all users and all departments, showing associations where they exist.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Users with departments will show their department.</li>
    <li>Users without departments will show <code>NULL</code> for department info.</li>
    <li>Departments without users will show <code>NULL</code> for user info.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important Compatibility Note:</strong> Standard SQLite (which `sql.js` uses) and older versions of MySQL do <em>not</em> directly support `FULL OUTER JOIN`. However, you can achieve the same result by combining a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> and a <code>RIGHT JOIN</code> (or two `LEFT JOIN`s) using <code>UNION ALL</code>, being careful to exclude the rows that are common to both (the `INNER JOIN` part) to avoid duplication.</p>

<p>Emulation using <code>LEFT JOIN</code> and <code>UNION ALL</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql line-numbers">
-- Get all users and their matched departments (LEFT JOIN)
SELECT u.name, d.department_name
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN departments d ON u.department_id = d.department_id

UNION ALL -- Combine results (duplicates allowed for now)

-- Get all departments that DON'T have a user match
SELECT NULL, d.department_name -- Select NULL for user name
FROM departments d
LEFT JOIN users u ON d.department_id = u.department_id
WHERE u.id IS NULL; -- Only include departments with no user match
</code></pre>
<p>This emulation gets tricky with more columns. Databases that support `FULL OUTER JOIN` make this much simpler.</p>
