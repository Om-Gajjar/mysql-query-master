<h1 class="mb-4">5.1 Introduction to Subqueries</h1>

<p>A <strong>subquery</strong>, also known as an inner query or nested query, is a query embedded inside another SQL query. Subqueries allow you to perform more complex operations by breaking them down into smaller, logical steps.</p>

<p>Subqueries can appear in several clauses, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>SELECT</code> clause (Scalar Subquery)</li>
    <li><code>FROM</code> clause (Derived Table)</li>
    <li><code>WHERE</code> clause (Filtering based on query results)</li>
    <li><code>HAVING</code> clause (Filtering groups based on query results)</li>
</ul>
<p>They are enclosed in parentheses <code>()</code>.</p>

<h2 class="mt-5">Subqueries in the WHERE Clause</h2>
<p>This is a very common use case. The subquery runs first, and its result is used by the outer query's <code>WHERE</code> condition.</p>

<p>Example: Find all users who are in the 'Engineering' department, using a subquery to get the department ID.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql line-numbers">
SELECT name, email
FROM users
WHERE department_id = (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM departments
    WHERE department_name = 'Engineering'
);
-- The subquery returns a single value (the ID for Engineering),
-- which is then used by the outer query's WHERE clause.
</code></pre>

<p>Example: Find all users who are in *any* department located in the 'departments' table (this is a bit redundant but shows the `IN` operator).</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql line-numbers">
SELECT name
FROM users
WHERE department_id IN (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM departments
);
-- The subquery returns a list of all department IDs.
-- The outer query finds users whose department_id matches any value in that list.
</code></pre>

<h2 class="mt-5">Scalar Subqueries in SELECT</h2>
<p>A scalar subquery returns exactly one row and one column (a single value). It can be used directly in the <code>SELECT</code> list.</p>
<p>Example: Show each user's name and the total number of departments (less practical, but demonstrates the concept).</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql line-numbers">
SELECT
    name,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM departments) AS total_departments
FROM users;
</code></pre>

  <strong>Note:</strong> In our sandbox database, the `users` and `departments` tables have a relationship through the `department_id` column in the `users` table that references the `department_id` column in the `departments` table.
