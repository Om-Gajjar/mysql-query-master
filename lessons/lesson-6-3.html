<h1 class="mb-4">6.3 Joining a Table to Itself: Self Joins</h1>

<p>Sometimes, relationships exist *within* a single table. A common example is an employee table where each employee might have a manager who is also an employee in the same table.</p>
<p>To query such relationships (e.g., list each employee next to their manager's name), you need to join the table to itself. This is called a <strong>self join</strong>.</p>

<p>When performing a self join, you <strong>must use table aliases</strong> to distinguish between the two instances of the same table in the query.</p>

<p>Syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql line-numbers">
SELECT
    alias1.column_name,
    alias2.column_name, ...
FROM
    table_name AS alias1 -- First instance (e.g., employee)
INNER JOIN -- Or LEFT JOIN, etc.
    table_name AS alias2 -- Second instance (e.g., manager)
ON
    alias1.linking_column = alias2.primary_key_column; -- e.g., employee.manager_id = manager.id
</code></pre>

<p>Example: Assume our `users` table now has a `manager_id` column that references the `id` of another user (their manager). Let's list each user and their manager's name.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql line-numbers">
SELECT
    emp.name AS EmployeeName, -- 'emp' alias for the employee instance
    mgr.name AS ManagerName   -- 'mgr' alias for the manager instance
FROM
    users AS emp -- Treat this instance as the employee
LEFT JOIN -- Use LEFT JOIN to include employees without a manager (e.g., the CEO)
    users AS mgr ON emp.manager_id = mgr.id -- Join employee's manager_id to manager's id
ORDER BY
    ManagerName NULLS FIRST, EmployeeName;
</code></pre>
<p>We use `LEFT JOIN` here so that employees whose `manager_id` is `NULL` (like top-level managers) are still included in the list, showing `NULL` for their manager's name.</p>
