<h1 class="mb-4">8.1 Creating Virtual Tables: Views</h1>

<p>A <strong>View</strong> in SQL is a virtual table based on the result-set of a stored SQL query. It contains rows and columns, just like a real table, but it doesn't store data itself (usually). Instead, when you query a view, the database executes the underlying query and presents the results as if they were coming from a table.</p>

<p>Views are useful for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Simplification:</strong> Hide complex joins or calculations behind a simple view name. Users can query the view without needing to know the underlying complexity.</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Grant users access to a view that exposes only specific columns or rows from underlying tables, restricting access to sensitive data.</li>
    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Provide a consistent structure even if the underlying table schemas change (though the view definition might need updates).</li>
    <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Define a common data representation once and reuse it in multiple queries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Syntax to create a view:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql line-numbers">
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name(s)
WHERE condition; -- The complete SELECT statement defining the view
</code></pre>

<p>Once created, you can query a view just like a table:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql line-numbers">
SELECT * FROM view_name WHERE some_condition;
</code></pre>

<p>Example: Create a view showing only users from the 'Engineering' department along with the department name.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql line-numbers">
CREATE VIEW engineering_users_view AS
SELECT
    u.id AS user_id,
    u.name AS user_name,
    u.email,
    d.department_name
FROM users u
INNER JOIN departments d ON u.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE d.department_name = 'Engineering';

-- Query the view
SELECT user_name, email FROM engineering_users_view ORDER BY user_name;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Updating Data Through Views:</strong> Updating data directly through views is possible under certain conditions (e.g., the view references a single table, includes the primary key, doesn't use aggregation), but it can be complex and database-specific. It's often safer to update the underlying base tables directly.</p>
